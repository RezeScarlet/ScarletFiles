### Installation
I started working on a install script to make things easier when formatting a machine. I didn't tested it yet. If it gives you problems open an issue.
1. Zen Browser doesn't have a Ros√© Pine theme yet, so use grub theme and stow to overwrite it's colors 
2. Set Rose Pine on Dark reader on Zen on dynamic mode
3. Use Minimal theme for Obsidian and the option Rose Pine on Minimal Theme settings
4. Use Rose Pine Theme for Vesktop
5. ```git clone https://github.com/RezeScarlet/ScarletFiles.git ~/```
6. ```cd ScarletFiles```
7. ```./install.sh```
8. Stow may warn about conflicts, rename them as backups and run it again.
